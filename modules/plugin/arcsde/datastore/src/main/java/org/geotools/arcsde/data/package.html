<BODY>
DataStore implementation for the ArcSDE 8.x and 9.x spatial gateway.

<p>
This implementation will work with the <a
href="http://edndoc.esri.com/arcsde/9.1/java_api/docs/index.html">ESRI
ArcSDE Java API</a>. This API is distributed by ESRI as a single jar
backed by couple of platform specific libraries (.dll or .so) if provided.
<p>
To allow developers to build without access to the above ESRI API
a dummy jar has been provided as a build dependency.
<p>
The feature set of the ArcSDEDataStore includes feature write
support but is actually limited to the in-process locking manager. Native
locking should be developed and will be highly appreciated, so volunteers
are wellcome.</p>
